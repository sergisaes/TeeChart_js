# TeeChartjs Demo

TeeChart for Angular uses the [TeeChart NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/TeeChart) instance of TeeChart for Javascript.

This example loads data from the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.6.

## Running notes

Key dependencies to load are (a separate load may not be required as both are generally present as default when loading environment node modules):

# npm install @angular-devkit/build-angular
# npm install canvas

With the dependencies in place ng build and serve will get the example up and running.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
